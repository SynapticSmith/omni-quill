Seamlessly generate AI-powered content in your WordPress editor using Google Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT with a simple prompt.

== Description ==

The "MP AI Content Generator" plugin seamlessly integrates powerful AI capabilities from Google Gemini and OpenAI (ChatGPT) directly into your WordPress post and page editor. Say goodbye to content blocks and tedious manual writing. With this plugin, you can generate creative text, expand on ideas, or create drafts simply by providing a prompt, all without leaving your WordPress dashboard.

Boost your content creation workflow, save time, and overcome writer's block by leveraging the power of AI right where you write.

**Features:**

– **Integrated Editor Experience**: Generate AI content directly within the Gutenberg editor (and Classic Editor for basic text insertion).
– **Flexible AI Model Selection**: Choose between Google Gemini AI and OpenAI's ChatGPT (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo) based on your preference and API key.
– **Simple Prompt Input**: A dedicated meta box in the post/page editor allows you to quickly input your content generation prompts.
– **Direct Content Insertion**: AI-generated text is automatically inserted as new paragraphs or headings directly into your post content.
– **Basic Markdown Recognition**: Converts `##` to `<h2>` headings and `**text**` to `<strong>`text`</strong>` for improved formatting.
– **Secure API Key Management**: Store your AI API keys securely in the plugin's dedicated settings page.
– **Dedicated Admin Menu**: Easy access to plugin settings via a top-level menu item in your WordPress admin sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get an AI API key? =
You can get your Google Gemini AI API key from Google AI Studio or your OpenAI API key from OpenAI Platform. Links are also available directly on the plugin settings page.

= Is this plugin compatible with both the Classic Editor and Gutenberg? =
Yes, it is primarily designed for Gutenberg, where it inserts content as native blocks. For the Classic Editor, it will insert plain text into the TinyMCE editor.

= What if the AI generates inappropriate or incorrect content? =
AI models can sometimes produce unexpected results. Always review and edit the generated content before publishing. This plugin is a writing assistant, not a fully autonomous content creator.

= Does this plugin store my content or API key externally? =
Your API key is stored securely in your WordPress database options table. The content generated by the AI is processed through the respective AI service (Google Gemini or OpenAI) and then returned to your WordPress site; it is not stored by the plugin itself beyond being inserted into your post draft.
